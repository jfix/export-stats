# Export stats

A hodgepodge of distributed functions to keep track of one percentage: _successful exports_.

* https://runkit.com/jfix/export-stats-get to retrieve two values: the number of `total` exports and the number of `success`

* https://runkit.com/jfix/export-stats-updater to update the database every day

* *TODO* Amazon lambda function to post daily reminder into Slack channel

* *TODO* runkit endpoint to be called from Slack buttons

* *TODO* pretty up the page here: https://jfix.github.io/export-stats/
